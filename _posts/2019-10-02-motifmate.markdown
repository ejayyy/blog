### set up for local running
1. install this app in the store
1. make a folder for project
    1. download all theme data
    1. generate emulator data
        - make a theme for the emulator
        - generate dummy data
            - making a new theme
        - use live data
            - it takes much time for downloading data
            - additional data generating (gift cards, store settings...)
                - like `{"gift_cards":[]}`
            - disable store pwd
                - what's that working for?
1. generate a local server
    - they automatically support site through port
    - even URL!
1. DONE
    - insanely easy STV...
