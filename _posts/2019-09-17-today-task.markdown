### ssl certificate
- slate's [direction](https://shopify.github.io/slate/docs/create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate)
    - adjusted `ipconfig` to `ifconfig`
- and then I got that msg : `does not have enough information to verify this certification`
    - is that [browser's configuration problem](https://serverfault.com/questions/177971/how-to-trust-my-own-self-signed-ssl-cert)??


### the others
- write the bash script down on the command line in the ubuntu env??
- handling 2 identities in one site through the URL
    - is this best way????
- I don't like politics..
